“Alexa, are you recording everything you hear?” It is a question more people are asking, though Amazon’s **voice assistant denies the charges**. “I only record and send audio back to the Amazon cloud when you say the wake word, ” she insists, before referring questioners to Amazon’s **privacy policy**. Apple’s voice assistant, Siri, gives a similar answer. But as smart speakers from Amazon, Apple and other **technology giants proliferate**, concerns that they might be **digitally snooping** have become more **widespread**.

As **Alexa** herself **contends**, smart speakers are not sending every **utterance** into the tech giants’ digital **vaults**. Despite their name, the devices are simple-minded. They **listen out for** wake words, and then send what follows to the cloud as an **audio clip**; when an answer arrives, in the form of another audio clip, they play it back.

- target online ads  定向投放在线广告

If **eavesdropping** is your problem, **eschewing** smart speakers does not solve it. Smartphones, which people **blithely** carry around with them, are even worse. **Spy agencies** are said to be able to **activate** the microphone in such devices.

If the Alabama **legislature gets its way**, abortion will soon become illegal there. A doctor **convicted of** performing an abortion could be **sentenced to** up to 99 years in prison. With no **exemptions** in cases of **rape** or **incest**, this would be the most **restrictive** such law in the country.

But other states with Republican-controlled legislatures have passed “heartbeat” laws that are almost as **absolute** — they ban abortion from 6 weeks, at which point many women do not yet realise they are **pregnant**.
- absolute  adj. 绝对的；完全的；专制的
- pregnant adj. 怀孕的；富有意义的
	- pregnancy  n. 怀孕；丰富，多产；意义深长

In the abortion argument, both sides long ago **drove each other to extremes**. The **pro-life**, **fundamentalist** view behind the Alabama **bill** is that a **fertilised** egg is no different from a person, and thus should enjoy the same legal rights. Accept that, and what right does a woman have to take a morning-after pill, or to end a pregnancy after a rape? The **pro-choice** extreme is that any restriction on abortion is an unacceptable **attempt** by government to control women’s bodies. With debate **gridlocked**, the focus is on the courts.

	- grid  网格

The latest abortion bills are about two things: preventing women from making a choice that is **properly** theirs, and getting a challenge to **Roe to the Supreme Court** where, **campaigners** hope, they can **smoke out** the new **conservative** majority.

Were Alabama’s law to come into force, the price would be paid by women too poor or **browbeaten** to travel to where abortions are legal. Some of them will end up attempting to **perform** abortions themselves, with drink, **drugs** or worse.

There will be days when you do not have much to do; perhaps because you are waiting for someone else in a different department, or a different company, to respond to a request. But you can see your boss hard at work and, more important, they can see you. So you make an effort to look busy.

Some of this may be a self-perpetuating cycle. If bosses do not like to go home before their underlings, and underlings fear leaving before their bosses, everyone is trapped.

The consequence is often wasted effort. Rather than work hard, you toil to make bosses think that you are. Leaving a jacket on your office chair, walking around purposefully with a notebook or clipboard and sending out emails at odd hours are three of the best known tricks. After a while this can result in collective self-delusion that this pretence is actual work.

But presenteeism has more serious consequences. It is perhaps most prevalent in Japan, where people attend the office even when they are in discomfort. In doing so, they are doing neither themselves, nor their employers, any favours.

Turning an office into a prison, with inmates allowed home for the evenings, does nothing for the creativity that is increasingly demanded of office workers as routine tasks are automated. To be productive you need presence of mind, not being present in the flesh.
