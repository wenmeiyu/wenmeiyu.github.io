Why are **airlines** so **keen on** the **fantasy** of the Mile-High Barbie?
- airline n.航空公司；航线  adj.航线的
- keen adj.着迷的 n.痛哭，挽歌
	- very interested 对某事着迷的
	- keen on sth. 对某事着迷
- fantasy n.幻想

How did it come to this—women required to **produce a sick note** because they’ve been **struck** down by… unsexiness? It seems that Norwegian Air requires female flight attendants to wear heels, or have a note from the doctor—other rules cover everything from makeup to false eyelashes.
- produce a sick note 出示病假条
	- produce 拿出，出示
	- show/offer sth.
	- produce a passport and a driving licence
- struck v.突然袭击 strike的原型 
	- be struck down 
	- I was struck down by flu 我因流感病倒了

How mortifying for Norway: in 2018, the country was rated second for equality, after Iceland, in the Global Gender Gap report. Norwegian politician Anette Trettebergstuen said: “1950 rang, and it wants its rulebook back.” Norwegian Air responded that flat shoes are worn in the cabin, there are also dress guidelines for male stewards, and other airlines have similar rules—but it must be aware that last month, Virgin ditched requirements for heels and makeup, with others following suit.

It seems that we’re finally starting to see off the oversexualised “air hostess” cliche, but how has it taken so long? Air travel isn’t alone when it comes to chauvinistic grooming diktats. Officially or unofficially, illegally or otherwise, women have routinely been pressured to dress quasi-sexually for work.

It’s a kind of chauvinistic laziness—an easy (and gratuitous) way to keep sex in the mix. Never mind that the flight attendants may have preferred comfort, elegance and dignity to styling that came perilously close over the years to Mile-High Barbie. On and off ground, airline staff have a big job to do—safeguarding the wellbeing and security of passengers. As with all work environments, if men aren’t required to totter about in heels, why on earth are women?

What happens to our data when we die? Elaine Kasket on a digital **dilemma**

Elaine Kasket is a **counselling** psychologist **based in** London. Her first book, All the Ghosts in the Machine: **Illusions** of **Immortality** in the Digital Age, **examines the ethical and technical issues** surrounding our data when we die.
At some point there will be more dead Facebook accounts than live ones.
- counselling n.咨询，辅导，特指专业性很强的或心理上的辅导
	-counselling psychologist  心理咨询师，心理咨询专家

	- issue n. 问题；流出；期号；发行物 vt. 发行，发布；发给；放出，排出


The Oxford Internet Institute recently predicted there could be 2bn dead Facebook accounts by the end of the century.
That’s a lot of data…

Although we’re doubling what we can store every couple of years, it’s not, like infinite — and our devices capture more and more stuff by default. That surplus data, either with the aid of artificial intelligence or human decision making will be jettisoned, and big tech will be making those decisions.

Meanwhile, people have to act like hackers to gain access to their relatives’ accounts…

They are forced to break the law. They are impersonating people, using other people’s passwords… I’m not sure if I’m happy to leave someone a set of my passwords; they might find things that were important, but they would have access to everything else. Even if one isn’t harbouring toxic secrets, that’s still quite a thing.

What’s the bare minimum you’d advise people to do?

It’s a good idea to clean your digital house frequently. If nothing else, you don’t want relatives buried under a hundredweight of undifferentiated data with no sense of what is important to you. The default is to become a digital extreme hoarder, with data up to the rafters. The things which are really important to you, the artefacts you want to pass on to future generations, put them in a physical form. You cannot trust corporations to safeguard your data.

Luckin has waged its cash-burning caffeine war with generous subsidies, speedy delivery and viral promotions on social media, which in turn has also pushed Starbucks to form a tie-up with local tech giant Alibaba to deliver coffee to customers.

According to the prospectus, its acquisition cost per new customer decreased to 16.9 yuan ($2.52) in the first quarter of 2019 from 103.5 yuan in the year-ago quarter, helped by the growth of its network and improved brand recognition.

“The big question for the brand long term is if, when it rolls back discounts, enough customers stick around, ” said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group, “But the company has completely rewritten the rules for the coffee business in China and has impacted Starbucks as well as a host of smaller players.”

At a **court hearing** in March, the **lead prosecutor** in the admissions case, Eric S. Rosen, said that college consultant William Singer had **tried to get** Zhao — whom Rosen did not **identify** by name — **recruited to the Stanford sailing team** and created a false **profile** of her supposed sailing achievements.


She was ultimately not recruited, but Rosen said that she was admitted to Stanford partly on the basis of those false credentials and that, after her admission, Singer made a $500, 000 donation to the Stanford sailing program.

Zhao appears to have participated in a recent conference hosted by the Princeton U.S.-China Coalition. Her biography on the group’s website said she was planning to major in Psychology and East Asian Studies and was interested in education policy in China.

Many Chinese **suffer discrimination** based on their **regional origin**
- suffer 遭受
	- suffer from 遭受
	- suffer hungry/suffer from hungry  挨饿
	- suffer discrimination 遭受歧视
	- discrimination n.歧视，区别
- regional origin 所属地域
	- regional  地域的，地区的
	- region  地区，地域
	- origin 起源，来源

Urban Chinese are often contemptuous of internal migrants, wherever they are from. But people from certain regions suffer higher than usual levels of negative stereotyping. Regional discrimination “is hard to see and touch” yet its impact is as painful as getting “a bloodied face”, said an academic quoted by a north-eastern newspaper.
- Urban Chinese 城里人
	- urban 城市的

People from Henan and the north-eastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning are among those most commonly targeted, partly because those areas are such big sources of migrants. Henan is a farming province of about 100m people. The latest census, in 2010, showed that 7.5% of Henanese were living outside their home province, the second-highest proportion of any province. The highest was Anhui, on Henan’s eastern border.

Egregious examples of regional stereotyping occasionally cause outcry. In 2017, an internet conglomerate known for its food-delivery app admitted to excluding applicants from certain regions for an open position. The company later apologised. After the incident, many locals and some sympathisers elsewhere vowed to show their displeasure by deleting the mobile app of the firm.

Some lawyers say a legal loophole is partly to blame. China’s employment law prohibits discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, sex, religion, disability, social background and health. Regional origin, however, is not mentioned. Some legal scholars and legislators have called for a wider law that would prohibit all kinds of unfair discrimination, including the region-based sort.

Cheating men can be spotted by their face type, study suggests

Philandering men have unfaithfulness written all over their faces, according to research that suggests men and women are able to spot cheating chaps just by looking at them.

Experts found men with more “masculine” faces were more likely to be thought to be unfaithful, and such men also self-reported more cheating or “poaching” of other men’s partners.

The team said being suspicious of men with masculine features — such as a strong browridge, strong jaw and thinner lips — might have offered an evolutionary advantage, allowing heterosexual women to spot a flaky partner and men to recognise a potential rival who might seduce their partner or leave them raising someone else’s child.

Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, researchers described how they asked heterosexual white participants to judge the facial features of 189 white adults who had been photographed and taken part in previous research.

The results showed men and women as a whole gave higher scores of unfaithfulness to the images of men who had self-reported more cheating or poaching.

When the team examined what about the men’s faces might have offered clues to their unfaithfulness, they found the standout feature was how masculine the face appeared.

Dr Kristen Knowles, an evolutionary psychologist from Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, said it was interesting the research made a clear connection between perceptions of infidelity and actual infidelity.

But Knowles stressed it should not be assumed that men with masculine faces were likely to be unfaithful. “We should be aware that these behaviours are incredibly complex, and are likely to be influenced by many factors, including social and cultural effects, personality, genetics and life experiences, ” she said.

There were no waiting **journalists** because his parents, the **Duke and Duchess** of Sussex (Harry and Meghan), had kept the location of his birth secret.

The relationship between Britain’s royal family and the media has long been strained. But two developments in recent years have made the palace and the press mutually less interested in each other. One is that British newspapers have toned down their royal muckraking. Tighter budgets mean that editors lack the staff to pursue princes and princesses as closely as they used to.

At the same time, the internet has made British papers less important to the monarchy. Readers can get their royal gossip from foreign publications that are not bound by British privacy or libel laws.

This is especially true of social media. The royal family has upped its social game, hiring a head of digital engagement in 2016. It now has several social-media accounts, each with millions of followers, who monitor the royals’ activities alongside those of Beyoncé or Kim Kardashian.

If the Alabama **legislature gets its way**, abortion will soon become illegal there. A doctor **convicted of** performing an abortion could be **sentenced to** up to 99 years in prison. With no **exemptions** in cases of **rape** or **incest**, this would be the most **restrictive** such law in the country.

- absolute  adj. 绝对的；完全的；专制的
- pregnant adj. 怀孕的；富有意义的
	- pregnancy  n. 怀孕；丰富，多产；意义深长

In the abortion argument, both sides long ago **drove each other to extremes**. The **pro-life**, **fundamentalist** view behind the Alabama **bill** is that a **fertilised** egg is no different from a person, and thus should enjoy the same legal rights. Accept that, and what right does a woman have to take a morning-after pill, or to end a pregnancy after a rape? The **pro-choice** extreme is that any restriction on abortion is an unacceptable **attempt** by government to control women’s bodies. With debate **gridlocked**, the focus is on the courts.

There will be days when you do not have much to do; perhaps because you are waiting for someone else in a different department, or a different company, to respond to a request. But you can see your boss hard at work and, more important, they can see you. So you make an effort to look busy.

Some of this may be a self-perpetuating cycle. If bosses do not like to go home before their underlings, and underlings fear leaving before their bosses, everyone is trapped.

The consequence is often wasted effort. Rather than work hard, you toil to make bosses think that you are. Leaving a jacket on your office chair, walking around purposefully with a notebook or clipboard and sending out emails at odd hours are three of the best known tricks. After a while this can result in collective self-delusion that this pretence is actual work.

But presenteeism has more serious consequences. It is perhaps most prevalent in Japan, where people attend the office even when they are in discomfort. In doing so, they are doing neither themselves, nor their employers, any favours.

Turning an office into a prison, with inmates allowed home for the evenings, does nothing for the creativity that is increasingly demanded of office workers as routine tasks are automated. To be productive you need presence of mind, not being present in the flesh.

What if an **asteroid** was about to hit Earth? Scientists **ponder** question
-What if ... 如果...怎么办

Here's a **hypothetical**: a **telescope detects** an asteroid between 100 and 300 meters in **diameter** racing through our **sola**r system at 14 kilometers per second, 57 million kilometers from Earth.
- hypothetical  假设的，假定的  n.假设，假定
	- a hypothetical question 一个假设问题
	- At present we won't speculate(v.推测,思索) on hypotheticals 我们目前不考虑任何假设情形

Astronomers estimate a one percent risk the space rock will collide with our planet on April 27, 2027. What should we do?

It's this potentially catastrophic scenario that 300 astronomers, scientists, engineers and emergency experts are applying their collective minds to this week in a Washington suburb, the fourth such international effort since 2013.

This week's exercise seeks to simulate global response to a catastrophic meteorite. The first step is aiming telescopes at the threat to precisely calculate its speed and trajectory, following rough initial estimates.

Then it boils down to two choices: try to deflect the object, or evacuate. If it is less than 165 feet in diameter, the international consensus is to evacuate the threatened region. What about bigger objects? The plan is to launch a device toward the asteroid to divert its trajectory — like a cosmic bumper car.

One issue that remains is politics, says Romana Kofler, of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs. "Who would be the decision making authority?" she asked. "The consensus was to leave this aspect out."

Theresa May **strode** out of the door of 10 Downing Street in a **crimson business suit** and **bowed to the inevitable**. Having failed three times to get her **Brexit deal** through a hopelessly divided **parliament**, and **confronted** with a Tory **insurrection** over her proposed fourth **attempt**, she announced on May 24th that she would **step down** as leader of the Conservative Party and Britain’s prime minister.

The immediate trigger for Mrs May’s departure was the failure of her revised withdrawal bill. But the bigger trigger was the general election that she called back in June 2017. Her instincts were right: increasing the Tories’ majority would have allowed her to increase her bargaining power with her party and ensure that she was not hostage to pro- or anti-Brexit factions. But the election was a debacle.

British politics will now be consumed by the race to succeed Mrs May. The next leader will have to grapple with the same forces that have destroyed Mrs May: a country as well as a party that is torn over Brexit; a political system that is being pulled apart by the tension between representative and direct democracy; and a conflict with the European Union that, despite repeated statements to the contrary by Brexiteers, has most of the cards in its hand. Mrs May will not be the last prime minister to be brought to tears by Brexit.

Tech’s latest stars have it all — **except** a path to high profits
- except  prep. 除…之外
	- prep. 除…之外   unless  besides  in addition to

Investors often describe the world of business **in terms of** animals. Right now, **mere ponies** are being presented as **unicorns**: privately held tech firms worth over $1bn that are **supposedly** strong and **world-beating** — **miraculous** almost.
- in terms of 就...而言，根据...来看
- mere ponies  
	- mere  不过，仅仅的  adj. 仅仅的；只不过的
	- ponies  小马   pony 的复数
	- pony  n. 矮种马；小型马  vt. 付清
- unicorns  独角兽
- supposedly   adv. 可能；按照推测；恐怕   据说，据传
- world-beating    世界一流的, 打败世界的
	- a world-beating athlete/company  世界一流的运动员，数一数二的公司
- miraculous    adj. 不可思议的，奇迹的
	- miracle  n.奇迹
	- a miraculous comeback  奇迹般地反败为胜
 
There is, however, a problem with the unicorns: their business models.

As we report this week, a dozen unicorns that have listed, or are likely to, posted combined losses of $14bn last year. Their cumulative losses are $47bn. Their services, from ride-hailing to office rental, are often deeply discounted in order to supercharge revenue growth. The justification for this is the Silicon Valley doctrine of “blitzscaling” in order to conquer “winner-takes-all” markets — or in plain English, conducting a high-speed land grab in the hope of finding gold.
- 

The big worry is that the unicorns' losses reflect not temporary growing pains but markets which are contested and customers who are promiscuous. Despite subsidies, ride-sharing customers are not locked in to one firm. No wonder Lyft’s shares have fallen by over 20% below their IPO price. Anyone can lease an office and rent out desks, not just WeWork.

External forces will make blitzscaling harder, too. Compared with the earlier generation of firms, today a reaction is in full swing, including over digital taxes and data and content laws.

All this is good for consumers. Investors, meanwhile, need to hold their nerve. It is tempting to extrapolate the triumph of Google and Alibaba to an entire new group of firms.

The blitzscale philosophy of buying customers at any price is peaking. After the unicorns, a new and more convincing species of startup will have to be engineered.

Bong Joon-ho has returned to Cannes with a **luxuriously watchable** and **satirical suspense drama**. It runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character, played by Korean star Song Kang-ho.
- luxuriously   华丽地，奢侈地

Song Kang-ho plays Ki-taek, a shiftless, unemployed man who lives in a chaotic, stinky and squalid basement with his wife, Chung-sook, his smart yet cynical twentysomething daughter, Ki-jung, and son, Ki-woo. They are all out of work and out of cash. Then Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune: an old school-friend helps him get a lucrative tutoring job. With a fake college diploma created by Ki-jung, he shows up at the fabulously lavish home of the Park family.

Likable Ki-woo is an instant hit with his new employers. Then the distrait lady of the house, Yeon-kyo, reveals that she also needs an art tutor for her young son, to mould his painting talents; Ki-woo suggests his sister (while concealing their relationship), and soon the brazen Ki-jung is also a success with these rich suckers.

The poorer family see themselves in a distorting mirror that cruelly reveals to them how wretched they are by contrast and reveals the riches that could — and should — be theirs. It is almost a supernatural or sci-fi story; an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers. Parasite gets its tendrils into you.

Why I won’t be joining the queue at the top of **Everest**
- Everest 珠穆朗玛峰
	- Chomolungma
	- Mount Everest

For a climber, looking at Nirmal Purja’s picture last week of the queues close to Everest’s summit — delays that may have contributed to several deaths – is something that inspires dread.
- inspires dread  让人不寒而栗
	- inspire vt. 激发；鼓舞；启示；产生；使生灵感
	- dread   恐惧，害怕，忧虑  v. 惧怕，担心；敬畏 n. 恐惧，可怕的人（或物）；（鸟群的）惊飞，惊起；将头发编成“骇人”发型的人 adj. 可怕的；令人敬畏的
	- a strong feeling of fear or worry
	- the dread of losing what we love 害怕失去所爱的恐惧
	- He is dreading the exam  他很担心这次考试

It depicts an anxiety-inducing conga line in the death zone above 8, 000 metres, where the body can’t properly function, and where movement forwards and backwards is seriously impeded. In a sport where efficient autonomous movement is regarded as crucial to safety, you want to ask, why would you put yourself in this position? The answer is to be found, in large part, in the commodification of the world’s highest mountain.

Everest has become largely detached from the rest of climbing and mountaineering. It has become a trophy experience, drawing too many otherwise without much interest in the sport.

The transactional nature of most Everest attempts has seen a shift in how aspirants view responsibility, moving it away from a question of an individual’s own judgment and subcontracting it to guiding companies, some excellent, some of them far less scrupulous.

For Nepal, where the spring Everest season is a valuable annual source of foreign currency, there is little interest in either limiting numbers or regulating the new cut-price Nepalese companies that have been set up to compete with the expensive foreign-owned guiding outfits.

Looking at Purja’s photo, it is not only dread you sense, but hubris, too. In the suggestion that its summit can simply be bought, a key point has been lost: that climbing is as much about judicious turning back and failure as it is about reaching the top.

Want a **visa** for the U.S.? You’ll have to **hand over** your social media **handles**

	- a door handle  门把手

The **vast** majority of **applicants** for U.S. visas will now have to hand over their social media usernames **along with previous** email addresses and phone numbers, according to a newly **imposed** rule.
- vast   adj. 广阔的；巨大的；大量的；巨额的

	- impose  vi. 利用；欺骗；施加影响  vt. 强加；征税；以…欺骗

**The State Department** was already collecting social media information, but only for those who had been **identified for additional scrutiny**, including people with a history of traveling to areas controlled by **terrorist** groups. That meant some 65, 000 people had to hand over that information. But now the number will include around 14 million applicants for **nonimmigrant** visas and some 700, 000 applicants for immigrant visas.
- The State Department 美国国务院
	- the U.S. Department of State  (DOS)
	- department   n. 部；部门；系；科；局
	- the State Council of the People's Republic of China 中华人民共和国国务院

	- terrorist incidents  恐怖事件
	- terrorist groups  恐怖组织
- nonimmigrant 非移民者，外来者
	- immigrant 移民者
	- immigrate v. 移民

Although applicants will be able to say they don’t use social media, lying about it could lead to “serious immigration consequences, ” a State Department official said.

For now the form only includes the most popular social media platforms, but soon applicants will be able to list all the sites they use. “As we’ve seen around the world in recent years, social media can be a major forum for terrorist sentiment and activity. This will be a vital tool to screen out terrorists, public safety threats, and other dangerous individuals from gaining immigration benefits and setting foot on U.S. soil, ” the official added.

When the new rule was proposed last year, the ACLU called it "ineffective and deeply problematic". The move “will infringe on the rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens by chilling freedom of speech and association, particularly because people will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official, ” the ACLU said.

China is a nation of tea-drinkers, but coffee is **taking off**
- taking off  起飞，突然开始成功，开始走红
	- to suddenly start to be successful or popular

Until the 1990s coffee was rarely served in China except at luxury hotels aimed at foreigners. When Starbucks opened its first outlet there in 1999 it was far from clear that the country’s avid tea-drinkers would take to such a different — and usually more costly — source of caffeine.
- luxury 奢华的
- outlet 经销点，专卖店

But coffee has become fashionable among the middle class in China. Starbucks now has about 3, 800 outlets in China — more than in any other country outside America. Statista, a business-intelligence portal, says the roast coffee market in China is growing by more than 10% a year. Starbucks and its rivals see big scope for expanding there.

So too, however, do home-grown competitors. A major new presence is Luckin Coffee. On May 17th Luckin’s initial public offering on the Nasdaq stockmarket raised more than $570m, giving it a value of about $4bn.

Luckin’s remarkable growth is a sign of change. No longer do Chinese consumers see coffee as such a luxury. The growth is striking given the country’s renown for its tea-drinking culture. Many residents like to relax in teahouses, sipping tea served gracefully by waiters from brass pots with long spouts.

But the two markets are different. The teahouses tend to cater to older people who like to spend long hours playing mahjong and gossiping. At the coffee shops it is rare to see anyone over 40. Young people use them for socialising, but much of their interaction is online — sharing photos of their drinks. An option on the Chinese rating app Dianping allows users to search for wanghong (“internet viral”) coffee houses: ones with particularly photogenic decor. Where better to sip and WeChat?

Apple **expected to** close iTunes after 18 years
- expected to  预计会发生...

Apple is to replace its iTunes download service. The tech company will announce that three separate apps for music, TV and podcasts will supersede iTunes, as Apple seeks to reposition itself as an entertainment service rather than a hardware company powered by products such as the iPhone.

Launched on 9 January 2001, iTunes was Steve Jobs’s then revolutionary platform for music storage, where users could rip their CDs into digital form. In 2003 the iTunes Store added the ability to buy tracks legally.

Although other companies — including Microsoft and Sony — had considered launching music stores, they “weren’t companies that had demonstrated Apple’s sophistication with regard to software”, according to the former Warner Music vice-president Paul Vidich.

But in the ephemeral world of tech, iTunes — and its use of downloads — quickly became old-fashioned as companies including Spotify introduced successful streaming models as “music’s most radically democratic era” began.

The writing seemed to be on the wall for iTunes when the tech company launched Apple Music in 2015, with rumours circulating that iTunes would not exist beyond 2020. A streaming service in a similar mould to Spotify, Apple Music signalled a move away from a download model, and arrived at the same time as the company’s radio service.

Western **firms** increasingly admire — and want — Chinese technology
- firms  n. 公司；商号  = companies 
	- firm adj. 坚定的；牢固的；严格的；结实的 vt. 使坚定；使牢固

American officials have been **treating** technology bosses to **classified briefings** on the dangers of doing business in China. Those who operate there see things differently.
- treating   v. 款待某人，请客
	- treat sb. to sth.
	- Let me treat you to a drink. 我请你喝杯咖啡
	- I'm going to treat myself to a new pair of sunglasses. 我想要给自己买一副新的太阳眼镜
- classified adj. 机密的，保密的
	- classify  v.归纳，归类，将文件或者情报定为机密
	- classified documents 机密文件
	- classified briefings 机密简报
- briefings n.简报，简要明示
	- brief adj. 简短的，V. 提供消息
	- a brief self-introduction 简短的自我介绍
	- breif on 提供消息
	- The HR briefed me on the job duties. HR向我告知了工作职责
	- President's Daily Briefing 总统每日简报

For the first time last year, in an **annual poll** by the EU **Chamber of Commerce** in China, a majority of foreign companies (61%) said that domestic firms were as innovative as European ones, or more so. This year four-fifths of them saw opportunities in Chinese sparkiness.
- annual poll  年度名义调查
	- poll 投票，民意调查
- Chamber of Commerce 商会
	- chamber 房间，会议厅，组织，机构
	- lower chamber 下议院
	- commerce 商业贸易
- domestic firms 国内公司
- innovative
- sparkiness

Today, acquiring a Chinese startup can help some foreign firms gain an edge. Takeover targets have their own research teams, patents, clients and, sometimes, lavish state subsidies.

In some cases the technology is hard to find elsewhere. In 2017 Faurecia, a French firm that is the world’s leading supplier of vehicle interiors, acquired Jiangxi Coagent Electronics, which develops human-machine interfaces. A person with knowledge of the deal says that Faurecia had been looking worldwide for a year before coming to China and spotting Jiangxi Coagent. “Faurecia said, ‘Wow’, ” he says, and made the Chinese technology the core of its offer.

All told, American technology companies have invested $1bn in Chinese ones since the start of last year, according to Dealogic, a data provider. Without trade tensions and the technological cold war, deals would multiply. That they now might not will delight America’s spooks. Its companies, less so.
