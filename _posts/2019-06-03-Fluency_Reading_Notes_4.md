Theresa May **strode** out of the door of 10 Downing Street in a **crimson business suit** and **bowed to the inevitable**. Having failed three times to get her **Brexit deal** through a hopelessly divided **parliament**, and **confronted** with a Tory **insurrection** over her proposed fourth **attempt**, she announced on May 24th that she would **step down** as leader of the Conservative Party and Britain’s prime minister.

The immediate trigger for Mrs May’s departure was the failure of her revised withdrawal bill. But the bigger trigger was the general election that she called back in June 2017. Her instincts were right: increasing the Tories’ majority would have allowed her to increase her bargaining power with her party and ensure that she was not hostage to pro- or anti-Brexit factions. But the election was a debacle.

British politics will now be consumed by the race to succeed Mrs May. The next leader will have to grapple with the same forces that have destroyed Mrs May: a country as well as a party that is torn over Brexit; a political system that is being pulled apart by the tension between representative and direct democracy; and a conflict with the European Union that, despite repeated statements to the contrary by Brexiteers, has most of the cards in its hand. Mrs May will not be the last prime minister to be brought to tears by Brexit.

Tech’s latest stars have it all — **except** a path to high profits
- except  prep. 除…之外
	- prep. 除…之外   unless  besides  in addition to

Investors often describe the world of business **in terms of** animals. Right now, **mere ponies** are being presented as **unicorns**: privately held tech firms worth over $1bn that are **supposedly** strong and **world-beating** — **miraculous** almost.
- in terms of 就...而言，根据...来看
- mere ponies  
	- mere  不过，仅仅的  adj. 仅仅的；只不过的
	- ponies  小马   pony 的复数
	- pony  n. 矮种马；小型马  vt. 付清

- supposedly   adv. 可能；按照推测；恐怕   据说，据传
- world-beating    世界一流的, 打败世界的
	- a world-beating athlete/company  世界一流的运动员，数一数二的公司
- miraculous    adj. 不可思议的，奇迹的
	- miracle  n.奇迹
	- a miraculous comeback  奇迹般地反败为胜
 
There is, however, a problem with the unicorns: their business models.

As we report this week, a dozen unicorns that have listed, or are likely to, posted combined losses of $14bn last year. Their cumulative losses are $47bn. Their services, from ride-hailing to office rental, are often deeply discounted in order to supercharge revenue growth. The justification for this is the Silicon Valley doctrine of “blitzscaling” in order to conquer “winner-takes-all” markets — or in plain English, conducting a high-speed land grab in the hope of finding gold.
- 

The big worry is that the unicorns' losses reflect not temporary growing pains but markets which are contested and customers who are promiscuous. Despite subsidies, ride-sharing customers are not locked in to one firm. No wonder Lyft’s shares have fallen by over 20% below their IPO price. Anyone can lease an office and rent out desks, not just WeWork.

External forces will make blitzscaling harder, too. Compared with the earlier generation of firms, today a reaction is in full swing, including over digital taxes and data and content laws.

All this is good for consumers. Investors, meanwhile, need to hold their nerve. It is tempting to extrapolate the triumph of Google and Alibaba to an entire new group of firms.

The blitzscale philosophy of buying customers at any price is peaking. After the unicorns, a new and more convincing species of startup will have to be engineered.

Bong Joon-ho has returned to Cannes with a **luxuriously watchable** and **satirical suspense drama**. It runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character, played by Korean star Song Kang-ho.
- luxuriously   华丽地，奢侈地
	- luxury  n.奢侈
	- luxurious  奢侈的
	- the luxury  group

- suspense  小说，悬疑
	- a suspense novel  一本悬疑小说
	- a suspense movie  一部悬疑电影
- drama  n. 戏剧，戏剧艺术；剧本；戏剧性事件
	

Song Kang-ho plays Ki-taek, a shiftless, unemployed man who lives in a chaotic, stinky and squalid basement with his wife, Chung-sook, his smart yet cynical twentysomething daughter, Ki-jung, and son, Ki-woo. They are all out of work and out of cash. Then Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune: an old school-friend helps him get a lucrative tutoring job. With a fake college diploma created by Ki-jung, he shows up at the fabulously lavish home of the Park family.

Likable Ki-woo is an instant hit with his new employers. Then the distrait lady of the house, Yeon-kyo, reveals that she also needs an art tutor for her young son, to mould his painting talents; Ki-woo suggests his sister (while concealing their relationship), and soon the brazen Ki-jung is also a success with these rich suckers.

The poorer family see themselves in a distorting mirror that cruelly reveals to them how wretched they are by contrast and reveals the riches that could — and should — be theirs. It is almost a supernatural or sci-fi story; an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers. Parasite gets its tendrils into you.

Why I won’t be joining the queue at the top of **Everest**
- Everest 珠穆朗玛峰
	- Chomolungma
	- Mount Everest

For a climber, looking at Nirmal Purja’s picture last week of the queues close to Everest’s summit — delays that may have contributed to several deaths – is something that inspires dread.
- inspires dread  让人不寒而栗
	- inspire vt. 激发；鼓舞；启示；产生；使生灵感
	- dread   恐惧，害怕，忧虑  v. 惧怕，担心；敬畏 n. 恐惧，可怕的人（或物）；（鸟群的）惊飞，惊起；将头发编成“骇人”发型的人 adj. 可怕的；令人敬畏的
	- a strong feeling of fear or worry
	- the dread of losing what we love 害怕失去所爱的恐惧
	- He is dreading the exam  他很担心这次考试

It depicts an anxiety-inducing conga line in the death zone above 8, 000 metres, where the body can’t properly function, and where movement forwards and backwards is seriously impeded. In a sport where efficient autonomous movement is regarded as crucial to safety, you want to ask, why would you put yourself in this position? The answer is to be found, in large part, in the commodification of the world’s highest mountain.

Everest has become largely detached from the rest of climbing and mountaineering. It has become a trophy experience, drawing too many otherwise without much interest in the sport.

The transactional nature of most Everest attempts has seen a shift in how aspirants view responsibility, moving it away from a question of an individual’s own judgment and subcontracting it to guiding companies, some excellent, some of them far less scrupulous.

For Nepal, where the spring Everest season is a valuable annual source of foreign currency, there is little interest in either limiting numbers or regulating the new cut-price Nepalese companies that have been set up to compete with the expensive foreign-owned guiding outfits.

Looking at Purja’s photo, it is not only dread you sense, but hubris, too. In the suggestion that its summit can simply be bought, a key point has been lost: that climbing is as much about judicious turning back and failure as it is about reaching the top.
