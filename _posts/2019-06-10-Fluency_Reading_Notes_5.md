Want a **visa** for the U.S.? You’ll have to **hand over** your social media **handles**
- visa  n. 签证 vt. 签发签证
- hand over 交出，移交
	- The enterpreneur handed over the company to his son  企业家退休把公司交给儿子来打理
- handles 名字，名称，昵称，把手
	- social media usernames
	- handle v. 处理，应付
	- be good at handing people  擅长和人打交道
	- a door handle  门把手

The **vast** majority of **applicants** for U.S. visas will now have to hand over their social media usernames **along with previous** email addresses and phone numbers, according to a newly **imposed** rule.
- vast   adj. 广阔的；巨大的；大量的；巨额的
- applicants 申请者
	- apply  vt. 申请；涂，敷；应用
	- applicant  n. 申请人，申请者；请求者

	- impose  vi. 利用；欺骗；施加影响  vt. 强加；征税；以…欺骗
	- The city imposed a ban on smoking in public places  强制实行公共场所禁止吸烟

**The State Department** was already collecting social media information, but only for those who had been **identified for additional scrutiny**, including people with a history of traveling to areas controlled by **terrorist** groups. That meant some 65, 000 people had to hand over that information. But now the number will include around 14 million applicants for **nonimmigrant** visas and some 700, 000 applicants for immigrant visas.
- The State Department 美国国务院
	- the U.S. Department of State  (DOS)
	- department   n. 部；部门；系；科；局
	- the State Council of the People's Republic of China 中华人民共和国国务院

	- terrorist groups  恐怖组织
- nonimmigrant 非移民者，外来者
	- immigrant 移民者
	- immigrate v. 移民

Although applicants will be able to say they don’t use social media, lying about it could lead to “serious immigration consequences, ” a State Department official said.

For now the form only includes the most popular social media platforms, but soon applicants will be able to list all the sites they use. “As we’ve seen around the world in recent years, social media can be a major forum for terrorist sentiment and activity. This will be a vital tool to screen out terrorists, public safety threats, and other dangerous individuals from gaining immigration benefits and setting foot on U.S. soil, ” the official added.

When the new rule was proposed last year, the ACLU called it "ineffective and deeply problematic". The move “will infringe on the rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens by chilling freedom of speech and association, particularly because people will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official, ” the ACLU said.

China is a nation of tea-drinkers, but coffee is **taking off**
- taking off  起飞，突然开始成功，开始走红
	- to suddenly start to be successful or popular

Until the 1990s coffee was rarely served in China except at luxury hotels aimed at foreigners. When Starbucks opened its first outlet there in 1999 it was far from clear that the country’s avid tea-drinkers would take to such a different — and usually more costly — source of caffeine.
- luxury 奢华的
- outlet 经销点，专卖店

But coffee has become fashionable among the middle class in China. Starbucks now has about 3, 800 outlets in China — more than in any other country outside America. Statista, a business-intelligence portal, says the roast coffee market in China is growing by more than 10% a year. Starbucks and its rivals see big scope for expanding there.

So too, however, do home-grown competitors. A major new presence is Luckin Coffee. On May 17th Luckin’s initial public offering on the Nasdaq stockmarket raised more than $570m, giving it a value of about $4bn.

Luckin’s remarkable growth is a sign of change. No longer do Chinese consumers see coffee as such a luxury. The growth is striking given the country’s renown for its tea-drinking culture. Many residents like to relax in teahouses, sipping tea served gracefully by waiters from brass pots with long spouts.

But the two markets are different. The teahouses tend to cater to older people who like to spend long hours playing mahjong and gossiping. At the coffee shops it is rare to see anyone over 40. Young people use them for socialising, but much of their interaction is online — sharing photos of their drinks. An option on the Chinese rating app Dianping allows users to search for wanghong (“internet viral”) coffee houses: ones with particularly photogenic decor. Where better to sip and WeChat?

Apple **expected to** close iTunes after 18 years
- expected to  预计会发生...

Apple is to replace its iTunes download service. The tech company will announce that three separate apps for music, TV and podcasts will supersede iTunes, as Apple seeks to reposition itself as an entertainment service rather than a hardware company powered by products such as the iPhone.

Launched on 9 January 2001, iTunes was Steve Jobs’s then revolutionary platform for music storage, where users could rip their CDs into digital form. In 2003 the iTunes Store added the ability to buy tracks legally.

Although other companies — including Microsoft and Sony — had considered launching music stores, they “weren’t companies that had demonstrated Apple’s sophistication with regard to software”, according to the former Warner Music vice-president Paul Vidich.

But in the ephemeral world of tech, iTunes — and its use of downloads — quickly became old-fashioned as companies including Spotify introduced successful streaming models as “music’s most radically democratic era” began.

The writing seemed to be on the wall for iTunes when the tech company launched Apple Music in 2015, with rumours circulating that iTunes would not exist beyond 2020. A streaming service in a similar mould to Spotify, Apple Music signalled a move away from a download model, and arrived at the same time as the company’s radio service.

Western **firms** increasingly admire — and want — Chinese technology
- firms  n. 公司；商号  = companies 
	- firm adj. 坚定的；牢固的；严格的；结实的 vt. 使坚定；使牢固

American officials have been **treating** technology bosses to **classified briefings** on the dangers of doing business in China. Those who operate there see things differently.
- treating   v. 款待某人，请客
	- treat sb. to sth.
	- Let me treat you to a drink. 我请你喝杯咖啡
	- I'm going to treat myself to a new pair of sunglasses. 我想要给自己买一副新的太阳眼镜
- classified adj. 机密的，保密的
	- classify  v.归纳，归类，将文件或者情报定为机密
	- classified documents 机密文件
	- classified briefings 机密简报
- briefings n.简报，简要明示
	- brief adj. 简短的，V. 提供消息
	- a brief self-introduction 简短的自我介绍
	- breif on 提供消息
	- The HR briefed me on the job duties. HR向我告知了工作职责
	- President's Daily Briefing 总统每日简报

For the first time last year, in an **annual poll** by the EU **Chamber of Commerce** in China, a majority of foreign companies (61%) said that domestic firms were as innovative as European ones, or more so. This year four-fifths of them saw opportunities in Chinese sparkiness.
- annual poll  年度名义调查
	- poll 投票，民意调查
- Chamber of Commerce 商会
	- chamber 房间，会议厅，组织，机构
	- lower chamber 下议院
	- commerce 商业贸易
- domestic firms 国内公司
- innovative
- sparkiness

Today, acquiring a Chinese startup can help some foreign firms gain an edge. Takeover targets have their own research teams, patents, clients and, sometimes, lavish state subsidies.

In some cases the technology is hard to find elsewhere. In 2017 Faurecia, a French firm that is the world’s leading supplier of vehicle interiors, acquired Jiangxi Coagent Electronics, which develops human-machine interfaces. A person with knowledge of the deal says that Faurecia had been looking worldwide for a year before coming to China and spotting Jiangxi Coagent. “Faurecia said, ‘Wow’, ” he says, and made the Chinese technology the core of its offer.

All told, American technology companies have invested $1bn in Chinese ones since the start of last year, according to Dealogic, a data provider. Without trade tensions and the technological cold war, deals would multiply. That they now might not will delight America’s spooks. Its companies, less so.
